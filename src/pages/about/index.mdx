## **About Us**

We are a technology-driven manpower and finance management company dedicated to connecting businesses with the workforce they need—efficiently, transparently, and securely.

Our platform streamlines the entire journey, from contract creation to payment settlement, ensuring every transaction is accurate, traceable, and compliant with business and financial standards.

### **Our Process**

Every client relationship begins with a contract. From there, our system manages all financial activities—payments, invoices, debit notes, credit notes, and refunds—through a unified, automated workflow.

Customers can pay online or offline via card, POS, bank transfer, or Sadad bills, with every payment instantly recorded and settled.

When adjustments or refunds are needed, our Credit and Debit Note approval process ensures proper validation before any change is applied. For seamless customer experience, refunds can be credited directly to the customer’s **Wallet**, allowing them to reuse or withdraw funds as per policy.

### **Our Technology**

We integrate with leading financial and government systems such as **Sadad** and **Muqeem**, enabling real-time payment updates, employee data management, and automated HRM synchronization.

Our workflow automation ensures that finance teams, sales representatives, and agents can operate in perfect sync, maintaining accuracy across all departments.

### **Our Vision**

To empower organizations with smart, automated financial and manpower management solutions that save time, reduce errors, and build trust between businesses and their customers.

### **Our Promise**

We deliver transparency, control, and confidence—helping our clients focus on growth while we handle the complexity of finance, operations, and workforce coordination.
