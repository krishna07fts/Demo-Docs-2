### 4.7 Refund Request

The **Refund Request process** is used when a customer asks for their money back — either from a **contract balance** (e.g., Terminate/Cancel) or from their **Wallet balance**.

**Example**

- Customer terminates a contract with **₹5,000 balance** left.
- Chooses **Refund** instead of Wallet.
- Accountant confirms → Finance Manager approves → Refund issued to bank account.
- If ₹1,000 of wallet balance is non-refundable → Revenue Invoice is created for ₹1,000, refund only issues ₹4,000.
