What is Tax Setup?
Tax Setup makes sure that when a contract is created, the correct tax percentage is applied to each expense.
For example: a Visa Renewal expense of 1000 SAR might need 15% VAT â†’ 150 SAR tax.
Expense List = menu
Expense Setup = prices on the menu
Tax Setup = extra tax charged on those prices
