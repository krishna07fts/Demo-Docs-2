### 2.3 What is Expense Setup

The Expense Setup is where you tell the system “how much to charge” for each expense depending on things like:
Employee’s Nationality
Employee’s Profession
Employee’s Gender
Think of the Expense List as a menu of expenses, and the Expense Setup as putting prices on that menu for different cases.
