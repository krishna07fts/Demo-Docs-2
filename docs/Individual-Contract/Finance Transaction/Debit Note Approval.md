### 10.5 Debit Note Approval

- A Debit Note Approval is required before adding extra charges to a customer’s contract.
This ensures that no one can add costs without finance review.
- Debit Note Approval = Finance must approve before any new charges are added to a contract.

**Example**

- The system already charged the package cost, but the user realized **transportation fee** (100 SAR) was missed.
- User raises a **Debit Note Request** for 100 SAR.
- Finance Manager reviews and **approves** it.
- A Debit Note of **100 SAR** is created and added to the customer’s contract.
