### 10.8 What is a Payment Notification?

- Think of it like a receipt alert the system gets when a customer pays through Sadad.
- Sadad = a government payment gateway in Saudi Arabia.
- Customers pay their bills (for contracts, invoices, etc.) using Sadad at banks, ATMs, or online banking.
- Once payment is made, Sadad sends a message (notification) back to the system saying:
Hey, this customer just paid X amount with this reference number.
