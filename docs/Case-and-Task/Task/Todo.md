What is ToDo?
- The ToDo module is like your task manager inside the system.
- It helps you organize and track all tasks, no matter where they come from.
- Think of it as a to-do list but with more structure.
Example:
Imagine you are a user managing recruitment:
- Internal Task: You ask HR to “Prepare Offer Letter Draft” for approval.
- Individual Sector Task: You create a task for “Correct Candidate’s Visa Number” (linked to a candidate ticket).
- Business Sector Task: A client company reports “Wrong Nationality in Job Order” → you create a task for your team to fix it.
