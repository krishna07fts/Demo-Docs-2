### 1.1 Task

What is a Task?
A Task is simply a piece of work or action item that needs to be done.
Example: “Upload candidate documents” or “Approve visa request”.
A Case is usually a bigger request from a client, and inside the case there may be multiple tasks.
Think of it like this:
Case = A full story/request (example: Visa Request).
Task = Small steps/actions to finish that story (example: Check documents, Approve payment).
