### 2.2 My Cases

What is My Cases?
The My Cases module is a place where users can track all the cases or tickets they are involved in.
Think of it as a personal dashboard for your work requests and tasks.
It uses the same workflow stages and actions as the Task/Exception modules, like:
New → In Progress → Resolved → Closed → Reopen → Cancel
The difference here is how the cases are categorized.
