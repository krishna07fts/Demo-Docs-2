### 2.1 Individual Exception(Vithivilakku) Form

What is a Case and Task Exception Form?
- The Individual Exception Form is a special request form used when something doesn’t follow the usual process.
- Think of it as a “make an exception” request for a specific candidate, contract, or customer situation.
- It’s used to document the exception, get approvals, and track the process.
Example
Imagine a candidate’s visa fee is unusually high due to an emergency processing request:
- HR creates an Individual Exception Form to request approval for this extra fee.
- CX Director reviews the reason and approves it.
- Finance Department checks the cost and approves.
- Form is Closed → Exception is granted.
- If either CX Director or Finance rejects, the form moves to Rejected → Exception is denied.
