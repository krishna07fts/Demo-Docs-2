**2.5.1 Sponsor Transferred W/O Approval**

This process is used when an employeeâ€™s sponsorship is transferred without formal approval, but only under specific conditions (like when they are not active or not listed in the external Muqeem system).

Think of it as the company updating records when an employee has already left or switched employers without going through the usual approval process.
