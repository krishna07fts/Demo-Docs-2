### 2.3 Business Ticket

What is a Business Ticket?
A Business Ticket is a case created to handle business-related issues or client requests.
It helps you track, manage, and resolve client problems in an organized way.
Think of it as a complaint or request form that flows through different stages until it is solved.

Example:
Imagine a client complaint:
Client says: “Payment not reflected in the system.”
You create a Business Ticket with priority “High.”
Stages go like this:
New → Ticket created.
InProgress → Finance team investigates.
Resolved → Finance updates that payment issue is fixed.
Closed → Client confirms payment is now showing.
If the problem reappears → Ticket goes to ReOpen and back to work.
