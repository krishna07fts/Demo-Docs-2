### 1.2 Employee Contract:

The Employee Contract module keeps track of each employeeâ€™s work contract with Arco.
It stores start/end dates, salary details, and allowances.
Contracts renew automatically every 2 years.
Users can filter contracts (Active / Near Expiry / Expired).
Salary changes are done by adding new contract lines, while old ones close automatically.
