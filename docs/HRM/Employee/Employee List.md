### 1.1 Employee List:

The Employee List Module is used to manage all employees (Business, Staff, Individual).
It stores mandatory details, tracks different statuses, and allows quick actions (like Iqama/Insurance/ATM management).
Each employee also has detailed records (Personal, Skills, Experience, Insurance, etc.).

**Mename:**

- The Mename system here simply means:
It is the internal system/website used by Arco to manage their employees (especially Arcoâ€™s own staff).
