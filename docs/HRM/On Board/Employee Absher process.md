### 2.12 Employee Absher process

- The 'Employee Absher' process ensures every employee in Saudi Arabia has a valid Absher account.
- First, they need a SIM card in their own name.
Next, they link their details and mobile number to set up the account.
- Once completed, the employee can renew Iqama, apply for visas, update health insurance, and use other government services.
- **Simply put:** Absher is the digital key that allows employees in Saudi Arabia to access all government services.
