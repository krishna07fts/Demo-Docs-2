### 3.5 Leave Reject Request

- Leave Reject Request = View-only tracking workflow that shows at which stage an employee’s leave was rejected (Settlement, Visa, or Travel).
- If settlement was already given → converts to loan and deducted monthly.
- Moves step by step until it reaches Completed (final rejection record).
