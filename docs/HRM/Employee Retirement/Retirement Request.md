### 5.1 Retirement Request

- The Retirement Request process is a step-by-step workflow for handling employee retirements.
- It starts in Case Management and syncs with HR for ARCO validation, customer approval, settlement, visa, and travel.
- Settlement is calculated per EOS Setup rules based on employee type and years worked in the Kingdom.
- The system automatically holds settlement until 10 days before LWD, then triggers payment, visa issuance, and travel processing.
- For lodging employees, a Check-In Lodging step is included.
- The workflow ensures all stages—Settlement, Visa, Travel, Lodging, HR Clearance—are tracked and finalized before marking the request as Completed.
