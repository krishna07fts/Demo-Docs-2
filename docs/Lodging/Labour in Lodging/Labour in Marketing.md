### 1.2 Labour in Marketing

- Labour in Marketing is like the deployment-ready pool of employees. It shows who is ready for work, with salary and lodging details, and lets HR/Marketing decide whether to:
- Keep them active for assignment,
- Send them for investigation (if issues arise), or
- Move them to rest (if they need a break).
- This ensures only fit and cleared employees are marketed to customers.
