### 1.1 Labour in Lodging

- Labour in Lodging acts like a control panel for employee housing. It shows who is in the lodging, what stage they are in (quarantine, training, ready, booked, exit, etc.), and allows HR to take quick actions like issuing ID cards, tracking food, and handling travel or Iqama.
- It’s mainly used by HR, Admin, and Operations to ensure smooth employee management from arrival → lodging → work assignment → vacation/exit.
