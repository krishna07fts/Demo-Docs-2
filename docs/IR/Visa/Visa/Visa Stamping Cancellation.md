**2.1.4 What is Visa Stamping Cancellation?**

- This happens when a candidate’s visa was already stamped (printed in the passport).
- But the candidate is later rejected or cannot travel, and has not yet arrived.

- Difference Between **Visa Stamping Cancellation** vs **Block Visa Cancellation:**
    - Block Visa Cancellation → Cancels unused visas (before stamping).
    - Visa Stamping Cancellation → Cancels a stamped visa (candidate rejected before travel).
