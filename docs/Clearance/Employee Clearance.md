## 2. Employee Clearance

- Employee Clearance ensures all pending dues (salary, loan, accruals, tickets, charges) are settled when an employee exits or takes leave.
- Workflow: New → Approved → Closed (updates & invoices) → Cancelled (if needed).
- Integration: Settlement items update HR records and generate finance invoices automatically.
